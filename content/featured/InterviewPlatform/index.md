Implemented an interview platform, a web app that generates interview tasks and questions for the
given tech stack and the level of experience of the candidate.
The platform allowed the company to send the interviews to the shortlisted candidates, track if the
candidate received the interview tests, and calculate the scores.
The candidate can also track the status of their applications and update their profile.
